Step 1: Type g++ and include main.cpp,gnode.cpp, and graph.cpp
Step 2: Type ./a.out to run the compiled code
Step 3: Two files will be created, originalGraph and PrimMST (not working)
Step 4: Copy those files into the GraphViz website
Step 5: Images will be created from that (originalGraph will be correct PrimMST WILL NOT)
