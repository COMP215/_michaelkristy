In this folder are two C++ files. I separated them to make it easier to read through what we did in class and what I was supposed to do on my own.

One labeled "inclassCodes.cpp" it is the work that we did in class and is working 100%. As it should be.

The second one is labeled "main.cpp" this code should work but I think I'm having a strange problem. When I try to pass my array to MergeSort it is only passing the first two values of the array and then stopping. I searched on the internet for quite a long time and changed my code around a lot even with specific examples from tutorials and was still having the same problem. Maybe you will find the problem in two seconds but as of now I can't find it.
